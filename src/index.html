        <h2><font color='white'>Behind 50 Years of HIT Songs</font></h2>
        <h5><font color='#f0f0f0'>
          Billboard has published a Year-End Hot 100 every December since 1958.
          The chart measures the performance of singles in the U.S. throughout the year.
          Here, I'll use 50 years data to find out the stories behind the "HIT".

      <h3><b> Superstars Are Not A Deciding Factor For "HIT"</b></h3>
      <h5> Before doing the data analysis, I thought that one song's success may depended in large part on the popularity of singers.
        If a singer is famous enough, his songs are likely to be a hit. However, after I looked into the data,
        I found 1154 out of 1989 (58%) singers who made one appearance on the Hot 100 chart do not make another appearance on the following year.
        The results came as a surprise to me, suggesting that the superstars are not an absolute cause of one song's popularity.</h5>

      <h3><b> Flash In The Pan VS. Marathon</b></h3>
      <h5> One of the interesting things about the data is that most of the singers on the list are ephemeral and don't live up to their glory days.
        To that end, I combed through the top 20 artists who regularly appear on the charts.</h5>
      <h5>As you can see, the singer who has the longest career span is Aretha Franklin, who lasted for 30 years.</h5>

        (both unique and total) increased over time. For each additional year,
        the total number of words increased by an average of 1.87 per cent and the
        number of unique words increased by 1.36 per cent.</h5>

        I found that "love" is the word with the highest frequency appeared in songs' lyrics. Words "don't", "know" and "like" are also have the high appearance frequency.</h5>
