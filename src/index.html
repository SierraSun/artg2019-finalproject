      <h2>Behind 50 years of HIT songs</h2>
      <h5>
        Billboard has published a Year-End Hot 100 every December since 1958.
        The chart measures the performance of singles in the U.S. throughout the year.
        Here, I'll use 50 years of those charts to find out the things behind Hit songs .
        <br> <br>
        "Hit songs have always been repetitive," Bonnie Hayes songwriter for Cher,
        Bette Midler, David Crosby and current chair of the songwriting department at Berklee College of Music.
        "If anything, hip-hop songs seem less repetitive to me.
        If you listen to the Kendrick Lamar record it seems to have less repetition and more varied content than a Beatles song from the '60s.
        That's gonna make a lot of people mad, but look at the data and you'll find it true."

    <h3><b> Superstars Are Not A Deciding Factor For HIT</b></h3>
    <h5> Before data analysis, I thought that a song's success depended in large part on the popularity of singers.
      If a singer is famous enough, then his songs are likely to be a hit. However, after I looking into the data,
      I found 1154 out of 1989 (58%) singers who made one appearance on the Hot 100 chart do not make another appearance the following year.
      The results came as a surprise to me, suggesting that the superstars is not an absolute cause of a song's popularity.</h5>

    <h3><b> Flash In The Pan VS. Marathon</b></h3>
    <h5> One of the interesting things about the data is that most of the singers on the list are ephemeral and don't live up to their glory days.
      To that end, I combed through the top 20 artists who regularly appear on the charts.</h5>
    <h5>As you can see, the longest lıved singer was Michael Jackson, who lasted 30 years, and Chris Brown, who lasted six years.</h5>

    <h3><b> Longer Songs And Longer Lyrics</b></h3>
    <h5> According to the data analysis, the average word count of songs
      (both unique and total) increased over time. For each additional year,
      the total number of words increased by an average of 1.87 per cent and the
      number of unique words increased by 1.36 per cent.</h5>

    <h3><b> "Love" Is the Eternal Theme</b></h3>
    <h5> Through doing word frequency statistics of the Charted Songs' lyrics through 50 years,
      I found that "love" is the highest frequency of Song Lyrics, and words "don't'' , "know" and "like" are also at the top.</h5>
